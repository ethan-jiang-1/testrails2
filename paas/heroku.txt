ruby runtime key points:
1) clone the repository to different local folder - require a local master with new configuration - no need to push to origin
2) change the db to postgres
   11) change the database.xml use 'postgresql'
   12) gemfile  use 'pg'
3) git push from application root, no need to precompile asset
   31) ensure the precompile works - especially the dependences of gem to make less...etc works
4) git push master
   32) git push heroku master - heroku is a remote git repository
5) database migration
   once the application is up-and-running,  ensure db has setup (also seed)
   heroku run rake db:migrate
   heroku run rake db:seed
   notice:  run command may have trouble behind the proxy
5) great info from logs - check right after deployment to see if there is anything wrong.
