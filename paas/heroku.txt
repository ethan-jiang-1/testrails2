ruby runtime key points:
1) clone the repository to different local folder - require a local master with new configuration - no need to push to origin
2) change the db to postgres
   11) change the database.xml and gemfile/gemfile.lock
3) git push from application root, no need to precompile asset
4) git push master
5) great info from logs - check right after deployment to see if there is anything wrong.
