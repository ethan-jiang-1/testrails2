Debug Rake
	Andrey Kouznetsov's answer didn't work for me using Ruby 1.9.3. The ruby-debug gem doesn't seem to support Ruby 1.9. I had to use the debugger gem: https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger.

	Add gem 'debugger' to my Gemfile's development group.
	Run bundle.
	Add require 'debugger' to the top of my rake task.
	Add a call to debugger where I wanted a breakpoint in my rake task.
	Run the rake task normally from the command line, e.g.: rake my:task.
